# Recommendation-System-for-Book-Crossing-Data
Recommendation System for Book-Crossing happens to be the challenge problem I chose to solve for 2019 Machine Learning Fellow in Cape Town position. The Book-Crossing data comes from Cai-Nicolas Ziegler of IIF and can be found here.  More information about the data is available in Ziegler et al.:  Improving Recommendation Lists Through Topic Diversification. Cai-Nicolas Ziegler, Sean M. McNee, Joseph A.
